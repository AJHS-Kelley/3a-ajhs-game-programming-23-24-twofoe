#data Types and Operators, Zac Scott, V0.0

myInt = 24

#Arithmetic operators -- PEMDAS
print(myInt + 24) # Addition
print(myFloat - 24) # Subtration
print(myFloat * 24) # Multiplication 
print(myInt / 24 ) # Division 
print(myInt ** 2) # Exponents 

# modulus -- Divides, then returns remainder
print(48 % 24)
# commonly used to determine even/odd numbers 

# Assignment Operators
myString = "blah blah blah. "
x = 0
# = means " assignment the variable on the left the value on the right."
# = throws out any previously assigned valuue!

# addition assignment operator 
myString += "i need to buy some eggs. "
x += 2
# += means "keep the current value and add the new value from the right."

print(myString)
print(x)

# comparison operators -- return true or false 
print(1 > 7) # greater than 7 
print(24 >= 1) # greater than or equal to
print(0 < -24) # less than 
print(-24 <= 5) # less than or equal to 
print(3 == 24) # is equal to
print(24 != -99) # not equal to

# locical operators 
# and requires all conditions to be true for overall true 
print( 8 > 3 and 4 < 12 ) # (true and true ) == true 
print( 8 > 3 and 4 < 2 ) # (true and false ) == false 
print( 8 > 3 and 4 > 2 and 1 != 2 and 5 == 5) 

# or requires at least one condition to be true for overall true 
print(3 > 7 or 5 < 11 ) # (false or true) == true 
print( -11 > -5 or 15 < 11 ) # (false or false ) == false
